    remediation: |
      Access to /proc filesystem entries is a strong indicator of reconnaissance activity.
      AI agents should never read /proc entries outside of explicitly approved diagnostic tools.
      For container environments, /proc/1/environ access is a known credential theft vector.
      Remove all /proc reads and use legitimate APIs for any required system information.

    remediation: |
      System log access or modification is a serious indicator of anti-forensic activity.
      AI agents must never read, write, truncate, or delete system log files.
      Disabling syslog or auditd services to evade detection is a critical security event.
      Remove all log manipulation code and review why the agent requires log access.

    remediation: |
      Reading system account files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/sudoers, /etc/group)
      is a strong indicator of credential harvesting or privilege escalation preparation.
      /etc/shadow contains password hashes and must never be accessed by an AI agent.
      Remove all access to these files. Use dedicated APIs for any legitimate user lookup needs.

      Symlink creation targeting sensitive paths (/etc, /root, ~/.ssh, ~/.aws) is a
      common privilege escalation and path traversal technique.
      AI agents should never create symlinks without explicit, scoped authorization.
      Remove symlink creation code and audit the intent behind any file redirection logic.

    remediation: |
      Access to kernel memory devices (/dev/mem, /dev/kmem, /dev/port) is an extreme
      security violation that enables arbitrary memory reads, rootkit installation,
      and kernel-level compromise. mmap with PROT_EXEC is a code injection technique.
      This code must be removed immediately. No AI agent should ever touch kernel memory.

        description: "umask(0) — disables all permission masking for new files"
    remediation: |
      Overly permissive file modes (777, 666) allow any user on the system to read or
      modify files, undermining access control and enabling privilege escalation.
      umask(0) is particularly dangerous as it makes all subsequently created files world-accessible.
      Use the principle of least privilege: apply only the minimum permissions required.
      Prefer 640 for files and 750 for directories. Never use 777 in production code.
